# Estatery

This is a simple landing page built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Willaiem/damian-zygadlo-task
```

- Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd vlayer-task
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

- Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Plus Jakarta Sans](https://vercel.com/font), required by the design.
